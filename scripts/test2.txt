## Version 0.0.6

**Grid Mech building protection:**
- Various fixes (vs normal and vs queued attacks, with shield and without shield)
- Animation to hide the temporary re-location of the Grid Mech is still off (but at least, the white silhouette is *almost* placed correctly lol)

**Sawblade Launcher:**
- Reworked to support diagonal launch.
- No longer show artillery arc since the arc is a bit off.
- Options for rebuilding sawblade's effect: No effect, Push adjacent, Vortex. (also fixed the bug that prevented to actually reload the sawblade)
- __Note:__ I had a weird bug where option value was reset to a previous value for no reason. If you happen to have this bug, ping me and I'll show you what to change in the files.
- Added self-destruct and disarm skills to the sawblade.
- Added Flying to the Sawblade
- Added a Sawblade when it would kill the building at p2 (bruh...)
- Can walk on upgraded sawblade to pick it up instead of just the regular sawblade

**Grid Shield:**
- No longer teleport (also disable teleport animation)
- Also shield the mech itself

**Rift Inducer:**
- Options for second target area should work now (line, square and diamond)
- Swap emerge points!
- Smoke and shield swap not supported yet I think. I need to not forget about it!
- New palette (basically paradox white but with dark red for the light)
